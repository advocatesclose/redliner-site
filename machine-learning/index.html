# Machine Learning

## Background

Redliner creates machine learning datasets in real time by watching your edits and recording them to a encrypted file within the app. This data cannot be accessed from outside the app.

## Market

Most law firms are organized as pass-through entities. Lawyers may be responsive
to tax incentives to invest in machine learning, including under the One Big 
Beautiful Bill Act ("OBBBA"). These incentives include the incentive to develop 
software to the extent creditable under Section 41 or deductible under the new
Section 174A of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by OBBBA.

### Section 41 Tax Credits

Section 41 of the Internal Revenue Code provides tax credits for increasing 
certain research activities, which may include activities relating to the creation
of datasets, models or other utilities to support secure, on-device machine learning
and intelligence capabilities.

We believe that law firms stand to benefit from Section 41. The assets of a law firm 
consist primarily of the human capital of its attorneys. When these attorneys 
leave, they take their human capital with them. These departures can be disruptive
to the economics of any law firm. Law firms may thus be particularly responsive to 
additional incentives to invest in technology that codifies the human capital of their 
attorneys into hardware-bound solutions that can be physically possessed by the firm.

Section 41 tax credits provide an incentive to codify institutional knowledge into 
hardware form. When these datasets are recorded into hardware, they are easy to value 
for accounting purposes. Software that assists large law firms with this task is expected 
to be of value to the extent it is essentially self-financing.

### Immediate Tax Expensing

Section 174A of the Internal Revenue Code provides for the immediate expensing of domestic 
research or experimental activities, which includes activities relating to the production of 
machine learning datasets or artificial intelligence software generally. 

This software is expected to be particularly valuable. Law firms may benefit from Section 174A 
because they are structured as pass-through entities and because they are engaged in work that 
is of a type that is particularly well suited to the production of machine learning datasets and of 
artificial intelligence software generally for use in their own practices. In particular, the 
value of machine learning datasets and artificial intelligence software generally to law firms 
is increased by the extent to which such software is relatively easy to value for accounting purposes. Software that assists law firms with the creation of such datasets and such software more generally is therefore expected to be of value to the extent it is essentially self-financing.

## Redliner
            
Redliner is designed to allow law firms to produce tax assets in the form of high-quality, hardware-bound machine learning datasets and artificial intelligence software. These datasets can be created in Redliner without additional work by the user.

### Section 41: Creditable Intelligence
            
Redliner is designed to allow law firms to create tax attributes for themselves in the form of artificial intellence assets. Because these assets are developed solely within the scope of a iCloud account, and because law firms already create such iCloud accounts for their attorneys, Redliner requires little to no incremental hardware investment or expenditure on the part of law firms. Law firms already provide their users with iPhones. Such iPhones come with iCloud accounts that are not identical to the user's personal iCloud account. Such iCloud accounts are controlled by the firms and not by the indvidual attorneys.

### Section 174A: Expensible Training
            
As amended by OBBBA, Section 174A allows for the immediate expensing of domestic research and experimental expenditures. This creates an incentive for large law firms to institutionalize their human capital into hardware forms. Because these activities are directed toward the production of artificial intelligence software and machine learning datasets, they may easily qualify as domestic research. Redliner makes this qualification invisible to the user, and thereby further eases the path toward the institutionalization of human capital.

## Valuation
                
The top 100 law firms in the world by revenue earned a combined total of approximately $176.5 billion in 2025. The average law firm earns a profit margin of approximately 50 percent. Partners at the top 100 law firms in the world may therefore have earned approximately $88.22 billion in profits in 2025. If federal, state and local income taxes were approximately 40 percent of earnings, then these partners may have paid approximately $35.2 billion in taxes in 2025. If the combined effects of changes to Section 41 and Section 174A under OBBBA allow law firm partners to offset 40 percent of these taxes, then the total market size for software that assists law firm partners in achiving such offsets is approximately $14.1 billion. If such software is priced at 10 percent of the achievable offset, then the earnings supportable by such software is $1.41 billion.
            
<p class="conclusion-text">Conclusion: The market for machine learning software for large law firms, if measured at a 15x multiple to the earnings figure estimated above, is approximately $21.18 billion.
